# 🏃‍♀️ Fitness Tracker  

A simple Python program that demonstrates **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts such as **inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism** through a fitness tracker system.  

## 📌 Features
- Create a user profile with name, age, and weight  
- Add and track walking steps  
- Display user profile information  
- Track heart rate (in child class `healthfitness`)  
- Estimate calories burned and approximate weight loss  

## 🛠️ OOP Concepts Applied
- **Inheritance** → `healthfitness` class inherits from `FitnessTracker`  
- **Encapsulation** → Heart rate is stored as a private attribute (`__heart_rate`)  
- **Polymorphism** → `calories_burned()` method is defined in the child class
